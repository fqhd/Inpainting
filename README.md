# Inpainting
A generative adversarial network that can repaint parts of images. If you want to learn about how this works checkout my youtube video on the topic. I explain in detail how the algorithm works, and ways in which you can develop and further improve the model if you wish to achieve state of the art results.

## Dataset

The images of flowers that were used to train this model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YefFoLEGwUGDdGyw7fBpWxfcKFW9-kEj/view?usp=sharing)
If you wish to train the stroke model, make sure you have the [strokes.npy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3WIdF_0p7errAx7eOQPzurIagEzJkO5/view?usp=sharing) downloaded as well.
